# Directions for execution and load pretrained 

1. Run python3 pos_tagger.py -f for FFN POS Tagger
2. Run python3 pos_tagger.py -r for LSTM POS Tagger
3. Run ffn_hyperparameter.py for checking accuracies while varying parameters without storing the model or accessing pretrained model.
4. Run lstm_hyperparameter.py for checking accuracies while varying parameters without storing the model or accessing pretrained model.
5. The pre-trained models are uploaded in Drive. Make sure to download and place in the same folder. 
	Link to Drive: 
	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tUDUo_e8wGdmPPLrziZmFivKAvH23Xwj?usp=drive_link
6. Run ffn.py or lstm.py if you want to save new models or use the previous pretrained model one instead of ffn_hyperparameters.py and lstm_hyperparameters.py
7. All the Images are named according the use.
8. Note if there is a Dataset folder containing the datasets necessary for running all the files.
9. Report_NLP_A2 is Report for the assignment.
